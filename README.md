# CS3235 Prototype

---

This is a prototype application for the CS3235 module offered in NUS School of Computing. It's a quick sample implementation of a 2FA to MFA authentication process.

The prototype only simulates the process and doesn't actually connect to any live services, nor any servers to store data. The application is purely browser based and client side.


External Library used:

- Twitter Bootstrap
- Ember.js
- jQuery
- Handlebars.js
- sha256.js


Application is currently hosted at [http://protoapplist.appspot.com/list/cs3235](http://protoapplist.appspot.com/list/cs3235)
